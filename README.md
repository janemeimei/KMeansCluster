# KMeansCluster

Introdution of Project

For this project I will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

Summary of Project

Using the datasetâ€™s 16 dimensions as predictors, I applied K-Means clustering to categorize schools into two clusters: private and non-private institutions. The model achieved an accuracy of only 22%, indicating that K-Means clustering struggled with this classification task. This poor performance suggests that K-Means may not be suitable, especially given potential class imbalance and the complexity of the data.

To improve performance, techniques such as oversampling the minority class, adjusting cluster initialization, or switching to more appropriate classification models like decision trees or support vector machines (SVMs) could be more effective.
